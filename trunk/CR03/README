Requires (among others) cmll (see the texlive-fonts-extra package for example) and ipe (for the figures)
Compile using make (or with pdflatex once all the figures are compiled).

Put figures in ipe format in figures/
Do not put any .pdf figure in figures/
If you want to use other (lightweight, of course) kind of figures, put them elsewhere, and adapt the Makefile if necessary
